⁵ Be kind and patient in a way that everyone can see. Remember that the Lord is near.
⁶ Do not worry about anything. Instead, pray to God about everything. Ask him to help you with the things that you need. And thank him for his help.
⁷ If you do that, God will give you peace in your minds. That peace is so great that nobody can completely understand it. You will not worry or be afraid, because you belong to Christ Jesus.
⁸ Now my friends, I want to say this to you. Fill your minds with thoughts about good things. Think about things that are true, clean, right and lovely. Always think about things which people know are very good.
